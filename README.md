# Rocket-Ship
For my final project for my AP Computer Science A class, I decided to learn how to build an iOS app using Swift. I used what I learned in the process to create this game, which I called Rocket Ship.

**Rocket Ship** is a one-player game in which the player follows directions on the screen and presses buttons accordingly. Think of it as Spaceteam but for one person.

Note: The UI has not been tested for iPads, so it might seem a bit wonky if you tried to run the game on an iPad.
